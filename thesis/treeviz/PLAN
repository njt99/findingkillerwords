how to connect parents
```tst
grid_to_clusters	needs to	set parent for new clusters
	should use	special grid
	should save	special grid
merge_clusters	must alter	cluster parents
	needs	child bbs
	should act after	grid_to_clusters
child bbs	should link to	parent bbs
bb merge order	should be	deep to shallow
```
