 * treecat | treeviz | dot.
 * output graph
   * one circle per cc of grid at depth N
   * circles r=n^{1/6}
   * edges connect layers
   * may need to have min_cc_size
   * label with {X region name if contained}
 * method
   * online.
   * accumulate grid as bitmap until memory trouble looms
     * KISS: oom is the main issue, so don't preallocate (yet)
   * loop:
     * greedy search to target density
     * [skimage.flood]
     * if small number remain, connect all to parent
   * cluster - boundary facet star graph
   * csgraph connected
 * rescue treecat from momsearch git history.
   * adapt to old tree format
