Intro

1. Math setup.
  Log(3)/2 theorem. (proposition 1.28)
  
  parameter space = compact region of C^3
  2x mapping from parameter space -> GL(2,C)
  2x mapping from GL(2,C) -> R (retrieves two of the coordinates)

  identities
  impossible identities
  
  reduce to PSL(2,C) inequalities
    length (complex)
    distance (complex)

2. CS setup.
  Rigorous verification.

3. {PSL(2,_)@,}AffApprox calculus.

4. Finding Killer Words.
  finding killer words in the presence of identities.

5. Appendices
  * programs
  * detailed affapprox proofs
