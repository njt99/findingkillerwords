This paper documents a computer-assisted procedure
for rigorously analyzing small hyperbolic $3$-manifolds.
Briefly, we will define a compact six-dimensional space ${\mathcal P}$
that parameterizes pairs of elements of ${\mathrm Isom}({\mathbf H}^3)$,
and then construct a regular binary space partition (BSP) tree
which subdivides ${\mathcal P}$ into subregions ${\mathcal P_i}$
and whose leaves are --- with a few exceptions --- labeled with killerwords.
These killerwords will encode miniature proofs that ${\mathcal P_i}$
cannot contain any points which correspond to
particular choices of pairs of generators of
any torsion-free discrete group of ${\mathrm Isom}({\mathbf H}^3)$.
This tree of mini-proofs will then be used
to exhaustively isolate all possible manifolds
which can have properties related to the dimensions of ${\mathcal P}$.

This method has been used as a foundation for tackling multiple long-standing
problems at the interface of hyperbolic geometry and low-dimensional topology.
In particular:
	topological rigidity of hyperbolic $3$-manifolds;
	the generalized Smale conjecture for hyperbolic $3$-manifolds;
	finding the closed $3$-manifold of least volume;
	and the Gordon conjecture on exceptional Dehn fillings.
