\section{Technical Introduction}
Here is a brief description of why Theorem 0.XX might be amenable to 
computer-assisted proof.
If a shortest geodesic $\delta$ in a hyperbolic $3$-manifold $N$ does not have 
a $\ln(3)/2$
tube then there is a 2-generator subgroup $G$ of $\pi_1(N)\break =\Gamma$
which also does not have that property.
Specifically, take $G$ generated by $f$ and $w$,
with $f\in \Gamma$ a primitive hyperbolic isometry
whose fixed axis $\delta_0 \subset {\bf H}^3$ projects to $\delta$, and 
with $w\in \Gamma$ a hyperbolic isometry
which takes $\delta_0$ to a nearest translate.
Then, after identifying $N={\bf H}^3/\Gamma$ and letting 
$Z={\bf H}^3/G$,
we see that the shortest geodesic in $Z$ (which corresponds to $\delta$)
does not have 
a $\ln(3)/2$ tube. 
Thus, to understand solid tubes around shortest geodesics in hyperbolic 
$3$-manifolds, we need to understand appropriate 2-generator groups, and this 
can be done by a parameter space analysis as follows.  (Parameter space 
analyses are naturally amenable to 
computer proofs.)

The space of {\it relevant} (see Definition 2.8) 2-generator groups 
in\break ${\rm Isom}_+({\bf H}^3)$ is naturally
parametrized by a subset ${\cal P}$ of ${\bf C}^3.$  
Each parameter corresponds to a
2-generator group $G$ with specified generators $f$ and $w$, and we call 
such a group a {\it marked group}. 
The marked groups of particular interest are those in which $G$ is
discrete, torsion-free, parabolic-free, $f$ corresponds to a shortest
geodesic $\delta$, and $w$ corresponds to a
covering translation of a particular lift of
$\delta$ to a nearest translate.  
We denote this set of particularly interesting marked groups by ${\cal T}.$
We show that if tuberadius($\delta) \le \ln(3)/2$ 
in a hyperbolic $3$-manifold $N,$ then 
$G$ must correspond to a parameter lying in one of seven small regions
${\cal R}_n,\ n=0,\ldots,6$ 
in ${\cal P}$.  
With respect to this notation, we have:

\vglue8pt {\elevensc Proposition 2.19}.
${\cal T} \cap ({\cal P} - \mathbold{\cup}_{n=0,\ldots,6}{\cal R}_n) = \emptyset.$
\vfill

The full statement of Proposition 2.19 explicitly describes the seven small
regions of the parameter space as well as some associated data.

Here is the idea of the proof.
Roughly speaking, we subdivide ${\cal P}$ into a billion regions
of varying sizes,
and show that all but the seven exceptional regions cannot contain 
a parameter corresponding to a  
``shortest/nearest" marked group.
For example we would know that 
a region ${\cal R}$ contained no such group if we knew that for each 
point $\rho\in {\cal R}$,
Relength($f_\rho) > {\rm Relength}(w_\rho).$  
(Here Relength($f_\rho$) (resp.\ Relength($w_\rho^{\phantom{|}}$))
denotes the real translation length of the isometry of ${\bf H}^3$ 
corresponding to
the element $f$ (resp.\ $w$) in the marked group with parameter~$\rho.$)
This inequality would contradict the fact that $f$ corresponds to $\delta$ 
which is a {\it shortest} geodesic.  Similarly, there are {\it nearest}
contradictions.
